## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Web Scraping Reliability**
   - **Risk**: Company websites vary in structure and may block scrapers
   - **Mitigation**: Implement multiple scraping strategies, fallback to manual input, respect robots.txt

2. **API Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Groq API costs and rate limits
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize prompts, implement caching, monitor usage

3. **Session Management**
   - **Risk**: Data loss during long sessions or page refreshes
   - **Mitigation**: Clear warnings about session limitations, quick re-upload options

### Legal Risks

1. **Web Scraping Compliance**
   - **Risk**: Violating terms of service for scraped websites
   - **Mitigation**: Implement rate limiting, respect robots.txt, scrape only public information
